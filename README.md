## Description

- What was your motivation? The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio to store my work as a student in the Columbi University Coding Bootcamp. The hopes for this portfolio is to improve it's interface and styling, which are skills I hope to attain as my journey through the Bootcamp progresses. I will eventually use this portfolio to diplay my hard work and prove to potential employers that I am up to the task.

## Usage

The use of "alt" text were added next to the images of the code for accessibility for the visually impaired. An example of what the "alt" texts may look like in the code is as follows: 
<img src="./assets/images/cost-management.png" alt="Three circles with a dollar symbol inside; a gear in the background"/>
This makes the app more accessible, and allows for more user friendly options in the event that the app image cannot be seen by the user.
